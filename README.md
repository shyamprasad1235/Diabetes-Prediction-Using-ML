# Diabetes-Prediction-Using-ML
In this project, our objective is to predict whether a person is affected by diabetes or not using various features such as Glucose level, Insulin, Age, BMI, Pregnancies, Diabetes Pedigree Function, Blood Pressure, and Skin Thickness. The dataset for the project is sourced from Kaggle.com, and its name is "PIMA Indian." The data has been pre-processed using imputation and the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). For prediction, we employ eight classification algorithms within the framework of supervised learning.

Hyperparameter tuning has been performed for the best three models, selected based on accuracy metrics. Among these models, the best-performing one is chosen and utilized for predicting diabetes using input values provided by the user.
